# Astro Docs Docs (AD<sup>2</sup>)

This is a personal work-in-progress to convert [Astro's Contributor Guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/contribute/) from individual Markdown files in a GitHub repo to a stand-alone website.

It's easier to write long-form content in Starlight than un-connected `.md` files!

I enjoy built-in navigation, tables of content while I write to keep me organized.

I can include the the components I'm documenting directly in the file. 

And, it's easier for our community members to read, navigate, and ultimately contribute to our documentation.

## Want to make your own Starlight documentation site?
```
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
