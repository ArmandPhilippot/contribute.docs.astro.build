[Editing a single page on GitHub.com](/first-time/4-edit-single-page/) is convenient for small text changes, but does not allow you to see a live preview of the site while you are working. It also does not let you easily edit multiple files at once, such as a guide and a reference page or a sidebar entry.

## Contribute PRs using an online code editor 

(e.g. StackBlitz, CodeSpaces CodeSandbox, Gitpod)

You can instead open a fork in an online IDE (integrated development environment) for a code editor and live preview without needing to set up any local development environment. Each online IDE has its own shortcut URL for opening an existing repository, and will allow you to create pull requests after you have made changes.

See specific instructions for opening an existing repository in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github), [StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/docs/platform/importing-projects/#import-from-github), and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started#start-your-first-workspace) on their respective websites.

Note that CodeSandbox and StackBlitz provide Astro syntax highlighting in their custom code editors, while Gitpod supports the full [Astro VSCode extension](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/#vs-code).

## Contribute PRs by Developing Locally

To begin developing locally, checkout this project from your machine.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:withastro/docs.git
```

You can install and run the project locally using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Head to [the pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) to get that set up. Then, run the following from your terminal:

```shell
pnpm install

pnpm start
```

If you’re copying these instructions, remember to [configure this project as a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork).

```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:withastro/docs.git
```

At any point, create a branch for your contribution.
We are not strict about branch names.

```shell
git checkout -b add/partial-hydration-typo-fix
```

### Helpful information about Forks

On GitHub you’ll need a “fork” of this repository to work on. This is your own copy where you can make changes. [Read more about forks in GitHub’s docs](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

#### Creating a fork
To create your copy, click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of any page in this repository.

#### Maintaining a fork
When you first create your fork, it will be an exact copy of this repository. Over time, `withastro/docs` will change as the docs are updated, but your fork won’t automatically stay up-to-date. Here are some ways to keep your fork in sync with this repo.

##### Manually via the GitHub UI
1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub
2. Click <kbd>Sync fork</kbd> and then <kbd>Update branch</kbd>

##### Manually from the command line
In the terminal on your computer:
1. Make sure you’re on the main branch: `git checkout main`
2. Fetch and merge updates: `git pull upstream main`
3. Push the updates back to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin main`

##### Automatically with a GitHub app
1. Go to [the “Pull” GitHub app page](https://github.com/apps/pull)
2. Click <kbd>Install</kbd>
3. Follow the instructions to select your fork

## Pages generated from outside sources

Some of our English-language pages are generated from outside sources and maintained in another repo. Currently, these files are `configuration-reference.md`, all of our error messages, and all those under the `/integrations-guides/` directory.

:::note
All of these English generated pages in the docs repo will have a dev-only warning at the top and the `githubURL`frontmatter property. Please do look at the top of the file before you make changes and submit a pull request, as there are additional instructions there when necessary.

Translated pages are always edited directly in the docs repo.
:::

## Creating a pull request

1. Choose a title that is short, but descriptive of your change. If your change does **not** require translating or a similar update to the other language pages (e.g. fixing an English typo), please include `[i18nIgnore]` in your subject. If you are translating a non-English page, please indicate the language in the subject. For example, to propose an edit to a French page, include `i18n(fr)` in the PR title.

2. Choose and fill out the appropriate template. Be sure to include any useful information or extra content, such as a linked Issue.

3. Submit your changes for review.

Every pull request needs to be [reviewed by our contributors and approved by a maintainer](/first-time/6-pr-review-process/).

The docs site will be automatically updated whenever pull requests are merged.
