description: How to file an issue on the Astro Docs repository.
---
You can [**file an new issue**](https://github.com/withastro/docs/issues/new/choose) to let us know of outdated, confusing, or incorrect documentation without attempting to fix anything. You can also let us know of any problems you encounter on the site itself.

These issues are separate from Astro core issues and are only read and managed by Docs Maintainers. Issues must be about problems or suggestions **for the documentation site only** and not feature requests, feedback about Astro itself, or requests for support.

We decide to add new content and rework existing content *in response to GitHub Issues*, so submitting an Issue is usually the first step to making a change. After an Issue has been considered by the community, we often reach out to community members to encourage them to submit PRs based on existing Issues. 

[Larger contributions](/first-time/5-larger-contributions/) to the docs are encouraged only after participating in Issues, as unsolicited material may not fit into our existing plans.

### How to file an issue

1. Visit the [new issue page](https://github.com/withastro/docs/issues/new/choose) and choose the appropriate kind of issue you want to file.

2. Fill out the template, providing all the requested information.

3. Wait! ðŸ˜… A maintainer will "triage" your issue by assigning it a label. They may or may not leave a comment at this time. This doesn't mean anything is wrong. It probably means that a maintainer does not have time to consider your issue at this time, and is only checking for the kind of issue you submitted, or determining which maintainer will be responsible for the issue.

4. A maintainer may also "assign" an issue to themselves or another maintainer. Assigning an issue means choosing which maintainer is ultimately responsible for overseeing the issue, guiding the discussion, and making the final decision about whether or not to ask for a community contribution or whether to close it. It does not mean that they are working on a solution themselves.

5. Feel free to ask for others opinions, from the community or from Discord, and ask them to comment on your issue. Commenting on issues helps us understand the nature of the problem, how many people are experiencing or feel the same, and gives us more perspectives as we consider the issue. (While you are waiting for comments on your issue, consider commenting on other issues, too!)

6. If you indicated that you were willing to make a PR with a solution to the issue, wait for approval from a maintainer. Then, create a pull request by [editing a single page](/first-time/4-edit-single-page/) for a smaller contribution or by using one of the methods suggested for [making a larger contributions](/first-time/5-larger-contributions/).
