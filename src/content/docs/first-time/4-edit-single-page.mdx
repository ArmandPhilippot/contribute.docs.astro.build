description: How to edit a single page on GitHub.com.

On every page in docs, you can find an "edit this page" link in the right sidebar on desktop mode. This is the way to make a contribution that updates a small section of one single page, such as a typo fix, right in your browser.

If you have never made a pull request (PR) before, or you do not know whether you will make more, or [larger contributions](/first-time/larger-contributions/) to docs in the future, this is a great way to make a small change to Astro docs!
