import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Choose a title that is short, but descriptive of your change. If your change does **not** require translating or a similar update to the other language pages (e.g. fixing an English typo), please include `[i18nIgnore]` in your subject. If you are translating a non-English page, please indicate the language in the subject. For example, to propose an edit to a French page, include `i18n(fr)` in the PR title.

2. Choose and fill out the appropriate template. Be sure to include any useful information or extra content, such as a linked Issue.

3. Submit your changes for review.

</Steps>

Every pull request needs to be [reviewed by our contributors and approved by a maintainer](/first-time/pr-review-process/).

The docs site will be automatically updated whenever pull requests are merged.
