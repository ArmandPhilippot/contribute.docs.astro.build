Every page on [docs.astro.build](https://docs.astro.build/) has an **Edit this page** link in the sidebar on desktop mode. Click that link to edit the source code for that page in GitHub. This is the way to make a contribution that updates a small section of one single page, such as a typo fix, right in your browser.

If you have never made a pull request (PR) before, this is a great way to make a small change to Astro docs! 

## Edit this Page via GitHub

<Steps>

1. Click the "Edit this page" link to be taken to the file with the source code for that page in **GitHub**.

2. Click on the pencil icon when viewing this file to edit it.

3. Check the **page frontmatter** for any editing instructions specific to this page.

4. Use GitHub's browser editor to make your proposed changes to the page.

5. After you make your changes, click **Commit changes**. This will automatically create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the docs in your GitHub account with the changes.

6. Once you have committed your edits to your fork, follow the prompts to **create a pull request**.

</Steps>
