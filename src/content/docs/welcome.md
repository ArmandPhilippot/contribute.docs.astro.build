Welcome to Sarah's personal work-in-progress Astro Docs Docs!

Since we are all spoiled by [Starlight for documentation sites](https://starlight.astro.build), Sarah was having difficulty staying organized while writing new contributor guides in plain old Markdown files in a GitHub repo. (Where's my auto-generated "On this page" table of contents?? Why can't I easily move between guides??)

This is the Unofficial Official Guide to contributing to Astro docs, and allows us to work with the best documentation framework available while we update and improve our guidance for contributors!
