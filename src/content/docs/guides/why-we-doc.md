title: Why we write documentation
description: Docs exist to help and support our readers, and must be written with that in mind.

Documentation is a source of truth.

Docs is support. Docs is record-keeping. Docs is even marketing, promotion and community building.

. . . But ultimately, docs **exist** to *help*. 

Good documentation helps some**one** do some**thing**: our goal is to document **how to build with Astro** and not how **Astro is built**.

We write to help a reader accomplish what they came into docs to do (learn, build, verify, upgrade, experiment, evaluate, convince, troubleshoot...) and then, as quickly as possible, **get out of docs and back to their own project**.
